Description: This Project aims to incorporate technology to determine waste generation and management, with a simple upgrade to the waste collection mechanism and its reporting.
It leverages RBAC to distribute responsibility for managing waste and resource people by creating three roles: Admin, Worker, and General Public.
Admin: Will be able to manage the waste collection process
Worker: Status of zone and request options for maintenance
General Public: Filled status of dustbins in each zone
